How to use the code:
    First see the example in src/example_simple.cpp to get an idea of how things work.

    Also see the Doxygen documentation generated by:
        cmake CMakeLists.txt
        make doc
    then look in:
        ./doc
    keep in mind doxygen must be installed for this to work.
